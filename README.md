# Deep-Learning CPSC - 8430 

There are 3 parts of homework assignments: HW1-1, HW1-2,HW1-3. 

All the files in the repository are .ipynb files.

To ensure a smooth experience with these notebooks, it's imperative to set up your environment correctly. This includes the installation of several key Python libraries and packages, which are instrumental in deep learning development. The following imports are essential:

torch: The backbone of our assignments, providing a dynamic and flexible deep learning framework.
torch.nn: A module within PyTorch, offering a wide array of predefined layers and utilities for building neural networks.
torchvision: This package enriches PyTorch by offering access to popular datasets, model architectures, and image transformations for computer vision tasks.
transforms: A subset of torchvision for performing common image transformations, enabling data augmentation and preprocessing.
copy: A Python module for creating copies of Python objects, useful for model tuning and experimentation.
torchsummary: A handy tool for visualizing model architectures, making it easier to understand and debug neural networks.
sklearn.decomposition.PCA: From scikit-learn, this component is crucial for dimensionality reduction and data analysis, often used in preprocessing steps.
numpy: The fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, indispensable for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
matplotlib.pyplot: A versatile plotting library, essential for visualizing data and model performance metrics.
tqdm: A minimalistic yet powerful tool for generating progress bars, enhancing the user experience during model training and data processing.
